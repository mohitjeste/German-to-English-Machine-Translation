She knows me
Do you smoke
Youre unusual
Youre not fit
Go find Tom

Be objective
Tom is a refugee
Tom got a tattoo
Your bags open

He is in college
Open this door
Its terrifying
Suit yourself

Give me the key
Everyone dreams
Admission is free

For what purpose
We need experts
Put your hat on
Are you excited

Tom seems busy
We began to kiss
The radio died

She is kind
She is very wise
Youre useless

She hated him
Dont be sad

I like apples
The jokes on me
Who built it
He is cranky
Ghosts exist
Summer is over

Those are mine
Tom answered
He stood up
I broke my leg
We knew enough
Was Tom caught

She went inside
Tom succeeded
You know I cant
He is photogenic

She didnt reply
Give it a try
Hurry home

A man must work
We study Arabic
Did you miss me
They found us
You are wrong
There is no hope

Do what Tom says
Its irrelevant
Im optimistic

We survived
He had a dog
Tom liked horses
Whats Tom like

Ill say no more
This is a lion
You were perfect
Tom avoided Mary
You know enough
Start over
I ordered a beer
He is overweight
Were they here
She dumped me
Write with a pen
He is kind
Do as I say
We were lucky
The tea is hot
Toms coming
Tom fooled Mary
We cant do that
She tied him up
Can we afford it
Get over here
Its bizarre
I began to cry
He worked hard
No problem
Im housesitting
Come quickly
Ill stay home
Theyll be OK
Im not happy
Play it cool
Ill be present
Tell Tom
Are you mad
He acts quickly
Im a teenager
Can I sit here
You need to rest
This is useless
I wont lose
The mic is yours
Choose carefully
Were doctors
Tom took cover
I know the area
I am pretty sure
Tom can get it
I dont think so
Can you be sure
Youre the best
Get away from me
Tom hurt himself
I must warn him
Mama cried
Toms lying
Be brave
Keep quiet
Leave her alone

Take my advice
Tom suggested it
Speak slower

She is obstinate
He dislikes me
Well meet again
Come closer

Tom saved us all
Hes in danger
He has no hat on
He behaved badly
Heres your desk

Come with me
Youre dying
He arrived late
Hes a historian
Tom applauded
Were out of tea

Let me do this
There is hope
Please hurry
It is a curse
I hate Tom now
Tom is my rival
She has a cold
It doesnt hurt
Dont leave us
Leave him alone
Youre vain
Lets start
Is it too salty
Do ants have ears
He seems kind
Im hungry now
Youre kidding
Keep Tom busy
It just bugs me
Hes in Tokyo
Youll go far
Open your eyes
Were surrounded
Tom grimaced
Well decide
This is sabotage
She seems rich
He comes at noon
Tom didnt win
Tom can change
It belongs to us
Tom gloated
I cant see it
I am a tourist
Its frozen hard
Their eyes met
Ill be there
Stop hitting Tom
He had no hat on
Tom surrendered
Someone coughed
Its forbidden
That car is hers
Sing us a song
Tom is shopping
We had fun
Tom coughed
Try the cake
I must go out
Do your best
Tom is wet
Tom relaxed
When do you run

A heavy rain fell
Tom winked
It hurts
You cant lose
We cant risk it
She deserved it
Tom has ambition
Tom is vague

Tom is useless
He heard a shout
You need to go
I miss college
She idolized him
Its hard
I never drink
Fish please
Is it serious
Ill fix it now
We are soulmates
Please help Tom
You owe me
Id like a salad
He did his duty
Do what you like
You look content
Mistakes happen
Tom is unusual
Did Tom seem busy
Am I mistaken
Tom never lied
I am weak
He was naive
It isnt mine
Wheres the exit

I like skiing
Wake Tom up
Talk to Tom
I cant reach it
He seems ill
I was coughing

Tom disagreed
She kissed him
Youre useless

We want peace
Im an optimist
The tea is hot
Who wants it
Do as you want
Stand up
Well work
